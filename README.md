# Map Maze Using SFML

A utility to visualize search algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra

## Steps taken:
- create src, assets, dependencies dirs
- DL SFML and ad lib include folders to dependencies
- set up CMake, CMakeLists.txt

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### TODO:
- [ ] fix movement with brute force (move up)
- [ ] fix bfs such that it shows final path only
- [ ] Add more algorithms
- [ ] Start Screen with menue
- [ ] add metrics to measure time
